\begin{abstract}
Although software maintenance makes up most of the work a software engineer will do in the workplace, Cal Poly requires Software Engineering undergraduates to take only two courses that cover software maintenance.  Considering this, is it ethical for the Computer Science department to state that the program is designed to produce software professionals?  The ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics lists maintenance as one of the primary focuses for a Software Engineer; given this, the department should require a more thorough instruction in the art of software maintenance for Software Engineering students.

\section{Facts}

The Cal Poly catalog states that the Software Engineering undergraduate degree ``prepares students to become software professionals who develop software 
products on time, within budget, and that meet customer requirements''. \cite{catalogDept}  It also says that the program differs from the similar Computer Science undergraduate degree program in four ways, one of which is having ``classes [that] include significant learning in engineering and management areas such as quality assurance, testing, metrics, maintenance, configuration management and interpersonal management skills.'' \cite{catalogDept}

Three courses in the Computer Science department's section of the 2011-13 Cal Poly Catalog have the word ``maintenance'' in their course description. \cite{catalogCourses}  In one of these, CSC 358 Computer System Administration, the reference is to ``system maintenance''. \cite{catalogCourses}  Given the course title and that the course is billed as teaching ``fundamental concepts of Unix system administration'', \cite{catalogCourses} we can conclude that the maintenance described is of an operating system and its components, rather than a single piece of software in which the maintainer is altering code.  Thus, this course is not of relevance to our discussion.

CSC 309's course description refers to ``maintenance of large software systems'', while CSC 406's simply mentions ``software maintenance''. \cite{catalogCourses}

George E. Stark claims that ``maintenance consumes between 60 percent and 80 percent of a typical product's total software lifecycle expenditures''. \cite{stark97}  Girish Parekh says that it is two-thirds of the lifecycle and consumes at least 50 percent of most programmers' time. \cite{parekh}

Andrews and Lutfiyya, while preparing in 1998 for a software maintenance course at the University of Western Ontario, found no courses at other universities in which students performed maintenance activities on legacy software. \cite{andrews} They also found that ``most computer science programs offer[ed] no more than two software engineering course''. \cite{andrews}

\section{Research Question}

Does the Cal Poly Software Engineering program include enough training in software maintenance in CSC 309 and CSC 406?

Cal Poly requires Software Engineering undergraduates to take only two courses whose course descriptions cover software maintenance, and those courses are designed to teach about several other topics as well. \cite{catalogCourses}  However, the ACM Software Engineering code of ethics lists software maintenance as one of the roles of a software engineer \cite{secode}, and studies have shown that software maintenance consumes a large portion of the software life cycle. \cite{stark97} \cite{parekh}

%%% Extant Arguments from External Sources %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Extant Arguments}

\subsection{Arguments For}

Andrews and Lutfiyya found that their software maintenance course ``gave students valuable experience in the qualitatively different task of software maintenance''. \cite{andrews}  Engle, Ford and Korson state that it is ``important for students to have experienced [software maintenance]''. \cite{engle}

\subsection{Arguments Against}

\subsubsection{Difficulty of Classroom Instruction}

Engle, Ford and Korson's project stemmed from a perceived ``difficulty of preparing a software system upon which maintenance can be performed''; their end product consisted of 10,000 lines of Ada code and 9 documents. \cite{engle}

Andrews and Lutfiyya avoided creating a large maintenance-ready system by involving several clients and working on free software projects under the GNU Project.  One student team had both their first and second projects cancelled due to a lack of available time on the part of the client; this meant they had to switch to new projects twice during the term. \cite{andrews}

In addition, Andrews and Lutfiyya faced complications in grading; each group was working on a different project and each had its own goals. \cite{andrews}  Grades could not even be fairly assigned based on the clients' satisfaction, as one group unknowingly implemented a feature that had been previously finished (but without an updated status in the project wiki). \cite{andrews}

Andrews and Lutfiyya also noted issues with finding available projects that would be stable enough that student code would not be irrelevant by the end of the course, yet new enough to be using cutting-edge technologies that the students were enthusiastic about. \cite{andrews}

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Applicability of the SE Code}

This paper will use the ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics as a basis for evaluating the ethicality of the Computer Science department's course offerings.  Therefore, we must first show that the SE Code may be applied to the department.

The preamble to the Code explicitly states that it applies to those engaged in the education of software engineers:

\begin{quote}
``Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems''. \cite{secode}
\end{quote}

A few sentences later, it reaffirms this:

\begin{quote}
``The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, including [...] educators''. \cite{secode}
\end{quote}

% SE Code: ``Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems.''

``The Computer Science Department educates students in the discipline of computer science'' and has an ``educational mission''. \cite{catalogDept}  Although we will make no claim that computer science is the same as software engineering, the department also claims that ``[t]he BS in Software Engineering prepares students to become software professionals''. \cite{catalogDept}  Therefore, the Computer Science department of Cal Poly falls under the educator category of those the SE Code wishes to regulate.

%   8.03. Improve their ability to produce accurate, informative, and well-written documentation.

%\subsection{Adequate Documentation}
%
%Section 3.11 of the SE Code states that a Software Engineer must ``[e]nsure adequate documentation, including significant problems discovered and solutions adopted, for any project on which they work.'' \cite{secode}
%
%The Oxford Dictionaries define ``adequate'' as ``satisfactory or acceptable in quality or quantity''. \cite{definitionAdequate}
%
%Documentation for a software project can take many forms: code comments, identifier names, API docs, user manuals. % Find source! %
%
%\subsubsection{Code Comments}
%
%Programmers new to writing code comments tend to write comments that explain the obvious \cite{sixWays}; not only do these comments not provide any positive value, but they are actually a detriment to the project:
%
%``Comments don't just save time, they cost it. They take time to read, and they spread out the actual code on the screen, so you can have less of it on your monitor to inspect at one time.'' \cite{sixWays}

\subsection{Accurate Descriptions of Employment}

Section 5 of the SE Code states:

\begin{quote}
``those managing or leading software engineers shall ... [a]ttract potential software engineers only by full and accurate description of the conditions of employment.'' \cite{secode}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{School vs. Employment}

It has been said that students should ``think of school as their job''. \cite{schoolJob}  If students are employees, are the teachers their managers?  Both teachers and managers hand out assignments; both teachers and managers give out grades based on performance. \cite{performanceReview}  This is an artificial construct (the department is not truly an employer to its students, aside from any extra-curricular employments), but it provides a useful mindset from which to evaluate Section 5.06 for the scope of this paper.

In addition to managers, the SE Code says that it applies to those persons who are ``leading software engineers''.  The Computer Science department has set out a list of courses that Software Engineering undergraduate students must take to graduate. \cite{catalogDegree}  In this way, they are leading students down a specified path of instruction in the field of Software Engineering and thus Section 5 of the SE Code applies to them.

Once again considering the ``school is a job'' adage, we can draw parallels between the ``employment'' discussed in section 5.06 and a student's time at a university.

\subsubsection{Accurate Description}

As stated previously, the catalog descriptions of the Software Engineering program state that a graduate will have experienced ``significant learning'' in maintenance activities. \cite{catalogDept}  As ``significant'' means ``sufficiently great or important to be worthy of attention; noteworthy'' \cite{definitionSignificant}, it is difficult to pin down whether or not any student has gotten ``significant learning'' in \emph{anything}, yet we will attempt to do so.

As previously discussed, there are two courses offered by the Computer Science department that we must consider when looking at an undergraduate's education in software maintenance.  These two courses are ``CSC 309 Software Engineering II'' and ``CSC 406 Software Deployment''.

CSC 309 is a ``[c]ontinuation of the software lifecycle. Methods and tools for the implementation, integration, testing and maintenance of large software systems. Software development and test environments. Software quality assurance. Group laboratory project. Technical presentation methods and practice.'' \cite{catalogCourses}

From this description, it appears that software maintenance is one of six core concepts covered in the course (implementation, integration, testing, maintenance, development and test environments, quality assurance).  In the longest quarter of the year at Cal Poly, there are 51 instructional days. \cite{polyCalendar}  Assuming an even spread of topic coverage, that gives less than 9 days of instruction about software maintenance.  In reality, the number is even less, since the course is usually taught for 2 or 3 days a week. \cite{309Schedule}

CSC 406 covers ``[d]eployment of a sizeable software product by a student team. Software maintenance and deployment economic issues. Management of deployed  software: version control, defect tracking and technical support.'' \cite{catalogCourses}  Again, we see that software maintenance is one of six primary topics addressed in a course taught three days a week. \cite{406Schedule}

With only 30 Monday-Wednesday-Friday instructional days in the quarter \cite{polyCalendar}, a Software Engineering student will receive approximately 10 days of instruction in software maintenance over the course of their academic career.  When compared to the total number of years spent at Cal Poly, this number does not appear to be ``noteworthy''.

  \caption{Percentage of time spent on maintenance in Software Engineering all courses (approximate).}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{termpaper/images/pie-chart-03}
\end{figure*}

As mentioned previously, professional studies have estimated 50-80 percent of a Software Engineer's working time is spent working on software maintenance. \cite{stark97} \cite{parekh}

\begin{figure*}[tbp!]
  \caption{Conservative estimate of working time spent in software maintenance as a Software Engineer.}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{termpaper/images/pie-chart-04}
\end{figure*}

Using the most conservative end of this estimation, we can say that the percentage of working time spent in software maintenance by professional Software Engineers is \emph{over 36 times more} than that spent in instruction in the Software Engineering program at Cal Poly.

Given these facts, it appears the department is not accurate in stating that Software Engineering students experience ``significant learning'' in software maintenance.

\subsubsection{Ethical Analysis}

If we can consider the Computer Science department to be equivalent to a student's manager or leader and the term of their enrollment to be employment, the department violates section 5.06 of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics by not accurately representing the amount of software maintenance done by students in the Software Engineering program.

A rule utilitarian will hold that Computer Science departments like Cal Poly's should hold to the SE Code when they can; regular breaking of the rules leads to societal distrust of the profession, which produces less happiness for both Software Engineers and those distrusting them.

In addition, section 1.6 of the SE code tells Software Engineers to

\begin{quote}
Be fair and avoid deception in all statements, particularly public ones, concerning software or related documents, methods and tools. \cite{secode}
\end{quote}

The courses required for a Software Engineering undergrad are part of a software engineering teaching method; thus, section 1.6 commands the Computer Science department to avoid deception when making statements about its Software Engineering program.

If, as previously determined, the program is not providing ``significant learning'' in software maintenance, as the department claims, the Computer Science department is making deceptive statements to current and prospective students about the Software Engineering program.

Section 1 regards ``the public interest'' and the subsections contained within are particulars about that subject. \cite{secode}  Utilitarianism is, in its essence, concerned with the public good.  Rule utilitarianism in particular emphasizes conformance to rules unless given a strong reason to not.  Therefore, rule utilitarianism would find unethical the Computer Science department's lack of adherence to Section 1.6 and, following, Section 5.06.
