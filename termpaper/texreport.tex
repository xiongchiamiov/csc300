\begin{abstract}
Although software maintenance makes up most of the work a software engineer will do in the workplace, Cal Poly requires Software Engineering undergraduates to take only two courses that cover software maintenance.  Considering this, is it ethical for the Computer Science department to state that the program is designed to produce software professionals?  The ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics lists maintenance as one of the primary focuses for a Software Engineer; given this, the department should require a more thorough instruction in the art of software maintenance for Software Engineering students.

\section{Facts}

The Cal Poly catalog states that the Software Engineering undergraduate degree ``prepares students to become software professionals who develop software 
products on time, within budget, and that meet customer requirements''. \cite{catalogDept}  It also says that the program differs from the similar Computer Science undergraduate degree program in four ways, one of which is having ``classes [that] include significant learning in engineering and management areas such as quality assurance, testing, metrics, maintenance, configuration management and interpersonal management skills.'' \cite{catalogDept}

Three courses in the Computer Science department's section of the 2011-13 Cal Poly Catalog have the word ``maintenance'' in their course description. \cite{catalogCourses}  In one of these, CSC 358 Computer System Administration, the reference is to ``system maintenance''. \cite{catalogCourses}  Given the course title and that the course is billed as teaching ``fundamental concepts of Unix system administration'', \cite{catalogCourses} we can conclude that the maintenance described is of an operating system and its components, rather than a single piece of software in which the maintainer is altering code.  Thus, this course is not of relevance to our discussion.

CSC 309's course description refers to ``maintenance of large software systems'', while CSC 406's simply mentions ``software maintenance''. \cite{catalogCourses}

George E. Stark claims that ``maintenance consumes between 60 percent and 80 percent of a typical product's total software lifecycle expenditures''. \cite{stark97}  Girish Parekh says that it is two-thirds of the lifecycle and consumes at least 50 percent of most programmers' time. \cite{parekh}

Andrews and Lutfiyya, while preparing in 1998 for a software maintenance course at the University of Western Ontario, found no courses at other universities in which students performed maintenance activities on legacy software. \cite{Andrews:2000:ERS:794188.794320} They also found that ``most computer science programs offer[ed] no more than two software engineering course''. \cite{Andrews:2000:ERS:794188.794320}

\section{Research Question}

Does the Cal Poly Software Engineering program include enough training in software maintenance in CSC 309 and CSC 406?

Cal Poly requires Software Engineering undergraduates to take only two courses that cover software maintenance, and those courses are designed to teach about several other topics as well. \cite{catalogCourses}  However, the ACM Software Engineering code of ethics lists software maintenance as one of the roles of a software engineer \cite{secode}, and studies have shown that software maintenance consumes a large portion of the software life cycle. \cite{stark97} \cite{parekh}

%%% Extant Arguments from External Sources %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Extant arguments}

Andrews and Lutfiyya found that their software maintenance course ``gave students valuable experience in the qualitatively different task of software maintenance''. \cite{Andrews:2000:ERS:794188.794320}  Engle, Ford and Korson state that it is ``important for students to have experienced [software maintenance]''. \cite{engle}

I have not found any arguments against including maintenance as a part of software engineering curriculum.

%%% Analysis %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Analysis}

The ACM's Software Engineering Code explicitly mentions software maintenance as one of the things software engineers should focus on. \cite{secode}

Contrast the amount of time spent on software maintenance in the field with the amount of time devoted to it in education.  Then, discuss how the SE code states that software engineers should be educated in software maintenance.
